> The collection of awesome software, tools, libraries, documents, books, resources and cool stuff about information security, penetration testing and offensive cybersecurity.

[`Information security (or InfoSec)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to data, or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the data confidentiality, data integrity, and data availability of data while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.

[`Penetration testing (or PenTesting)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) is the practice of launching authorized, simulated attacks against computer systems and their physical infrastructure to expose potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system’s defenses which attackers could take advantage of. This is like a bank hiring someone to dress as a burglar and try to break into their building and gain access to the vault. If the ‘burglar’ succeeds and gets into the bank or the vault, the bank will gain valuable information on how they need to tighten their security measures. Should you discover a vulnerability, please follow [this guidance](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/guidance/) to report it responsibly.
